    "# QUES.1 What is Flask Framework? What are the advantages of Flask Framework?\n",
    "# ANSWER \n",
    "Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python. It's designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. Here’s an overview of Flask and its advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask Framework Overview:\n",
    "Minimalist: Flask is minimalist and unopinionated, meaning it provides the basic tools to build a web application without imposing any restrictions or dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensible: It allows developers to add any libraries they need, making it highly customizable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jinja2 Templating: Flask uses Jinja2 templating, which helps in rendering dynamic content easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Built-in Development Server: Flask comes with a built-in development server and debugger, making it easy to debug and test applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Werkzeug: Flask is based on the Werkzeug WSGI toolkit, which provides a solid foundation for web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Flask:\n",
    "Simplicity: Flask is straightforward and easy to learn. Its simplicity makes it ideal for beginners and for small to medium-sized applications where complexity might not be necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility: Flask does not impose any dependencies or project structure, allowing developers to choose the tools and libraries they want for their projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Great Documentation: Flask has excellent documentation that is easy to follow, making it easier for developers to get started and find solutions to problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Community and Ecosystem: It has a large and active community, which means there are plenty of extensions and resources available to extend Flask's functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideal for Prototyping: Due to its simplicity and ease of use, Flask is great for prototyping and building MVPs (Minimum Viable Products) quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "RESTful: Flask is well-suited for building RESTful APIs, which are lightweight and scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling: While Flask is great for small to medium-sized applications, it can also be used to build larger applications by integrating it with other libraries and tools as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Flask is favored for its simplicity, flexibility, and ease of use, making it a popular choice for developers looking to build web applications in Python.\n"

    "# QUES.3 What is App routing in Flask? Why do we use app routes?\n",
    "# ANSWER \n",
    "In Flask, app routing refers to the mechanism of associating URLs (routes) with specific functions (view functions) that are executed when the URL is accessed by a client (usually a web browser). This routing system allows Flask applications to respond to different HTTP requests (like GET, POST, etc.) on different URLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we use app routes in Flask?\n",
    "URL Mapping: App routes define the mapping between URLs and the corresponding Python functions that handle those URLs. This allows you to define what happens when a user visits a specific URL on your website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating Endpoints: Each route in Flask represents an endpoint of your application. Endpoints are unique locations that clients can interact with, such as accessing a webpage, submitting a form, or fetching data via an API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling HTTP Methods: Routes in Flask can specify which HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) they should respond to. For example, a route can handle a GET request to display a webpage and a POST request to process form submissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularization and Organization: By defining routes, you organize your application into logical components. Each route and its associated function handle a specific part of your application's functionality, making your codebase easier to manage and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic URLs: Flask routes can include dynamic components (URL parameters) that allow for variable parts in the URL. For instance, /user/<username> can match URLs like /user/johndoe and /user/sarah.\n",
    "\n",
    "URL Generation: Flask provides a mechanism for URL generation based on route names. This allows you to reference routes by their logical names rather than hardcoding URLs throughout your application, improving flexibility and maintainability.\n",
